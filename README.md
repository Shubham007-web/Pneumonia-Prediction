# Pneumonia Prediction
Pneumonia prediction for given data X ray images.
- The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.
- The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
- This data is train tensorflow Convulational Neural Network,I stacked 5 layer of neuron and one output layers.
- The model accuracy is about 62%.
- This model weights can also saved for the further uses or deployment.
